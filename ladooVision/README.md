# Challenge 2: Lovely Ladoos

## This week's featured region: India

It's Diwali season in India! Diwali is a festival that celebrates the victory of light over darkness. Families celebrate with fireworks and light up every house in the country with diyas, a type of Indian candles. A very popular delicacy that Indians eat during Diwali is ladoos.

Ladoos are balls of flour dipped in sugar syrup. Since we're in the middle of a global pandemic, most of the celebrations have to be done from home and we have to be innovative to find our inner child to have fun during Diwali 2020. Thanks to technology, however, we're still connected to our loved ones virtually!

## Your challenge üçΩ

Create a machine learning model that can analyze images of ladoos made for Diwali. This way, folks can upload an image of their ladoos and see how well the model predicts whether they are a proper ladoo. You'll want to create a serverless function to handle image uploads to test the model. You'll also need a dataset of ladoos, and we've added some in this folder, but make sure to train on other types of sweets like doughnut holes, for comparison. Tip: use a browser extension to scrape the web for more images. Your ladoo model will serve as a judge to your skill in making ladoos. This is a playful way to channel your inner child for Diwali!
